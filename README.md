# UART System
A "UART Transmitter and Receiver System" implemented on the FPGA board for my EEET2476 â€“ Advanced Digital Design 2 course

# Hardware
- DE10 Standard FPGA board
- CH341A USB to Serial Converter
- Laptop/PC
- NI VirtualBench

# Software
- Quartus Prime 18.1
- Terminal v1.93b
- ModelSim 10.5b
- NI VirtualBench Software

# What I Learned
- Understood the ideas of building a UART Controller by using common digital building blocks (counters, timers, shift registers, flags)
- Modified the given code and developed a new feature: receive a character from the Terminal, wait for 1 second, and echo it back to the Terminal 4 times
- Implemented the sequential logic approach and experimented with the Finite State Machine for comparison
- Tested and debugged the system using the DE10 FPGA and VirtualBench
